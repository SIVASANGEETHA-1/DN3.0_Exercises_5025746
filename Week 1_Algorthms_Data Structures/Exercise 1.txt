******************Exercise 1: Inventory Management System*************************


Step 1: Understand the Problem

Data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories because they enable efficient storage and retrieval of data. In an inventory management system, we need to store and manage a large number of products, each with its own attributes such as product ID, name, quantity, and price. A suitable data structure can help us to:

Store products in a way that allows for fast lookup and retrieval
Efficiently add, update, and delete products from the inventory
Scale the system to handle a large number of products
Some suitable data structures for this problem are:

Arrays: simple and efficient, but may not be suitable for large inventories
Linked Lists: dynamic and efficient, but may have slower search times
Hash Tables (e.g., HashMap): fast lookup and insertion times, suitable for large inventories
Trees (e.g., Binary Search Tree): balanced trees can provide fast search, insertion, and deletion times


Step 2: Setup

Create a new Java project for the inventory management system.

Step 3: Implementation
import java.util.HashMap;

// Define a class Product with attributes like productId, productName, quantity, and price
class Product {
    private int productId;
    private String productName;
    private int quantity;
    private double price;

    public Product(int productId, String productName, int quantity, double price) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.productName = productName;
        this.quantity = quantity;
        this.price = price;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public int getProductId() {
        return productId;
    }

    public void setProductId(int productId) {
        this.productId = productId;
    }

    public String getProductName() {
        return productName;
    }

    public void setProductName(String productName) {
        this.productName = productName;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }
}

// Choose an appropriate data structure to store the products (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap)
class Inventory {
    private HashMap<Integer, Product> products;

    public Inventory() {
        products = new HashMap<>();
    }

    // Implement methods to add, update, and delete products from the inventory
    public void addProduct(Product product) {
        products.put(product.getProductId(), product);
    }

    public void updateProduct(int productId, Product updatedProduct) {
        products.put(productId, updatedProduct);
    }

    public void deleteProduct(int productId) {
        products.remove(productId);
    }

    public Product getProduct(int productId) {
        return products.get(productId);
    }
}




Step 4: Analysis

The time complexity of each operation in the chosen data structure (HashMap) is:

Add: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (when hash collisions occur)
Update: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (when hash collisions occur)
Delete: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (when hash collisions occur)
Get: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (when hash collisions occur)
To optimize these operations, we can:

Use a good hash function to minimize hash collisions
Use a load factor to dynamically resize the HashMap when it becomes too full
Consider using a different data structure, such as a Tree, if the inventory is very large and search times become a bottleneck.
